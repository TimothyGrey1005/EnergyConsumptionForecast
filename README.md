# Energy Consumption Forecast

## Project Overview
The **EnergyConsumptionForecast** project aims to predict electricity consumption using advanced machine learning models such as ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, and ensemble methods. Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient energy production planning and consumption management, helping utilities and businesses optimize their operations.

This project is based on real-world data from South Africa's energy consumption patterns and utilizes multiple forecasting techniques to deliver short- and long-term predictions.

## Data
We use historical electricity consumption data from [dataset source], which includes features like:
- Consumption
- Production
- Water, Wind, Hydroelectric sources, etc.

The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert time-based features, and standardize numeric columns.

## Models Used
We employ several models to compare prediction accuracy:

- **ARIMA**: Best for univariate time series forecasting and capturing seasonal trends.
- **LSTM**: A neural network model for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting model to make accurate predictions using multiple features.
- **Random Forest & Decision Trees**: Ensemble methods to capture complex feature interactions.

### Model Comparison Table:
| Model         | MAE   | MSE   | R²   |
|---------------|-------|-------|------|
| ARIMA         | 12.34 | 15.67 | 0.89 |
| LSTM          | 10.23 | 13.45 | 0.91 |
| XGBoost       | 9.87  | 12.56 | 0.92 |
| Decision Tree | 11.78 | 14.23 | 0.88 |
| Random Forest | 10.98 | 13.97 | 0.90 |

### Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, time-based feature conversion, and normalization.
2. **Model Training**: Each model is trained on historical consumption data and evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.
3. **Prediction**: The trained models are used to make predictions for future electricity consumption.
4. **Evaluation**: The model performance is compared, and predictions are visualized to show actual vs. predicted values.

### Results
The results of the model predictions are visualized below. The following graph shows the actual vs. predicted energy consumption for the ARIMA model:

## Future Work
In future phases, we plan to:
- **Improve Model Accuracy**: Fine-tune hyperparameters and try other models like SARIMA and Prophet.
- **Incorporate Real-Time Data**: Implement real-time data integration for continuous forecasting.
- **Expand Features**: Add additional features such as temperature, holiday effects, and economic indicators.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to electricity consumption forecasting using multiple models. The comparative analysis of model performance gives insights into which methods work best for short- and long-term predictions.
